use RID object instead of passing bytes

BERTLV.create?

Handle RID/Issuer proprietary tags (EMV 4.2 Book 3, note 9, page 96):
Payment system-specific tags are interpreted within the context of the application RID. 
Issuer-specific tags are interpreted within the context of the Issuer Identification Number (as defined in ISO/IEC 7812-1). 
Additionally, to satisfy business requirements such as proprietary domestic processing, 
multiple issuers may agree on the definition of a private class tag. 
Such tags may be interpreted in the context of other data such as Issuer Country Code.


Application selection: PSE example (when PSE present)
-SELECT DDF 1PAY.SYS.DDF01 of PSE to find Payment APPs (returns SFI of Directory Elementary File/PSD) [This establishes the PSE and makes the initial Payment System Directory accessible]
--if returns SW != 9000 -> use "list of AIDs"-method (book 1, side 162), else continue
-for recnums 1-X (until SW==6A83): READ RECORD in Directory Elementary File/Payment system directory (returns record) 
--record listing ADF/DDFs (available apps)
---If no records found -> use "list of AIDs"-method
-SELECT desired APP (based on known AIDs, or on priority, or just interate all apps).
-GET PROCESSING OPTIONS 
--returns available Files (SFI records)
--Iterate ALL files
--Collect data from files
--Use collected data to perform desired operation (transaction)

TVR set by Terminal - sent in CDOL to GENERATE AC
The terminal shall also check the Last Online ATC Register for a zero value. If it is zero, the terminal shall set the "New card" bit in the TVR to 1.
Issuer Action Codes - Interpreted as TVR bytes



Check out MasterCard Paypass M/Chip spec (only available to licenced customers)

SELECT APP by partial AID (partial name selection): see book 1 page 150


-Alternatives 
---brute force AIDs
---direct select AID
---select group of AIDs by using first n bytes of AID as DDF name
